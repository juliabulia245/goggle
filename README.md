# goggle
Search better |

## Purpose
Quicker searching, not having to scroll past ads and irrelevent search results.

## Problem Example
Searching Google for 'hermes' yields the following SERP:

That's a lottttt of scrolling before I get to what I was looking for. Especially on mobile.

## Solution
Goggle allows you to have more control over your search results.

In the example above, I wanted to read about the Olympian diety. Even if the Wikipedia page /was/ the first result, I'd still have to click on it and wait for that page to load to read more. The snippet was not particularly useful to me, since I wanted to know what Hermes is the god of. I could have searched "what is hermes the god of" or "who is hermes" instead, but I'm usually more impulsive than that when I search.

## Features
